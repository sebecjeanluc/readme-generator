# Readme Generator

## About this project

This project is about developing a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file for open-source GitHub projects. Utilizing the Inquirer package, the application will simplify the process of creating a detailed README that includes information on the app's purpose, usage, installation, issue reporting, and contribution guidelines. The aim is to enhance the quality of open-source projects and encourage community contributions, while allowing project creators to focus more on development work.
